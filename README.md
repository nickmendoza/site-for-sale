# Site For Sale Landing Page

### Summary:
Easily offer all of your sites for sale by displaying a message and listing a contact email address for your primary and parked domains.  It will dynamically display the domain for whichever site was visited in the site's title and on the page itself.  It also dynamically lists the current copyright year, based on the server's date.
